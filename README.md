Task:
-------
This is a two-week final project at Makers Academy.
As a cohort, for the final project,  we generated ideas for a product that we want to work on. Then we categorized all ideas into 5 categories: 
After that, everyone got two votes and voted for categories they want to work.
That is how we become a MixMakers team, working on a mobile app.
Our idea for an app is a cocktail search app.
We have chosen this idea because it could be easily split into small steps and also it has a large room for adding features.
I first idea involved image recognition for cocktail search so that user can take a picture of alcohol that user has and search for available cocktails.
We decided to start with small steps and first of all defined an MVP (minimum viable product) for our app.


User Story:
-------

```
User can open an app from his phone
```
```
User can enter multiple ingredients and see what he is searching for
```
```
User can search for ingredients and see available cocktails
```
```
User can click on one of the cocktails cards and
see the full list of ingredients and instructions.
```
```
User can swipe card and go back to the cocktail page
```
```
User can go back to search page
```
